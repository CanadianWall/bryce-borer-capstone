1. Install dependencies. There is no .env file on the front-end.
2. Run the application with $ npm start
3. Currently only the Home page is working (Trends, Log In, etc are not fully functional)
4. To make the foodvisor API work, all images you want to send need to be in the back end images folder "bryce-borer-capstone-api\assets\images\food-images"
5. Food images need to be less than 70kb and jpg format (this is a limitation on the foodvisor API).
6. In the food-images folder, I have saved a some pictures that work well with the API, so give them a try.
7. I highly recommend testing out with other images you find online!
